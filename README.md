This is a Tkinter gui that connects to a postgres local database. It starts by having you login and choose your host, then it allows you to select from 3 users, usera, userb, userc, each with specific rights to tables in the postges database. You will have to alter this code to connect to your database on your local host, and enter in your own password. I chose a randomgenerated online password and used it in this instance.This project is to show that I can use Tkinter to make a GUI, that I can connect to a database and retrieve information, and shows a little of my sql code skills.
